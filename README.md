## üìã Project Synopsis

This is my lab project for the Machine Learning Programming course.  
In this lab, I worked with both a realistic e-commerce dataset and a synthetic dataset.  
I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to follow a 12-step data processing pipeline.  
The goal was to clean, transform, and analyze real-world data and practice basic data engineering.
